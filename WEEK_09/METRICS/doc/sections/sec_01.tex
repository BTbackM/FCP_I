\section{Introduction}

  Semantic segmentation evaluation metrics are used to measure the performance of
  a semantic segmentation model, accurately segmenting the pixels of an image or
  classifying each pixel into a semantic category/region. This metrics provides
  quantitative measures to compare how model's predictions match the ground truth
  annotations\cite{goodfellow2016deep, intelligence2021modern}.
